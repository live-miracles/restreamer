### Basic features:
- User can create a stream and give it a name (i.e. English or Spanish)
- User can select a stream key for the stream or generate a new one.
- For each stream user can add multiple outputs.
- User can select encoding for each output. Some options are: source, rotate. 
- Once stream receives feed you can turn On/Off the outputs. This can be done dynamically without disturbing other outputs.
- There should be two input RTMPs for each stream: main and backup. User should be able to manually select which one should be used for outputs.

### Other features:
- User can upload a video to the server.
- User can use the video as a source feed for any of the streams.
- User can start stream recording.
